Some interesting stuff that I've done.

The Python subdirectory has some code that I've done in that language.

The Technology_document.zip file is a quite old technological survey that I
did for a non-profit organization once.  Presented in a mini-website format
and as an example of the sort of reports that I do.

The JapanTrip.txt is my famous trip report on my fabulous gig as a
consultant in Japan.
